# scraper
For some reason, I'm running into what I believe is a local network issue. I've reproduced the same problem on several tools (postman, insomnia, hoppscotch) and every GET request to any public website results in an ECONNREFUSED error.

Unfortunately, in the interest of time, I've tabled this solution while I work on the DSL parser. The Typescript code is still uploaded and available to peruse however.

I chose Typescript because it has some guardrails in place vs common Javascript and it's quick to iterate and script something in it. I would've gone with Rust but I'm not super confident in my Rust coding yet.
